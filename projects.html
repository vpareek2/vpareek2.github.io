            </div>
            <p>Graph Zero is a novel AlphaZero-style algorithm incorporating Graph Attention Networks for improved game state representation, implemented in pure CUDA and C++. Scaled training to 8 GPUs, optimizing HPC performance using NCCL, resulting in an algorithm that outperforms AlphaZero in TicTacToe and Connect4, with promising progress in Chess. A paper detailing this innovative approach is currently in progress.</p>

            </div>
            <p>BitDB is a lightweight skeleton database similar to SQLite, written from scratch in C equipped with various memory ops and db tools. BitDB utilizes Ruby for testing various database scenarios and edge cases. It features a natural language to code assistant named Ada, implemented using MLX for native mac support with a finetuned Mistral-7B model.</p>

                <span class="project-date">October 2023</span>
            </div>
            <p>This project involves developing a machine learning application to convert text into Braille, a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired. The core of the project is a long short-term memory neural network model implemented using JAX and Haiku. The model is trained to predict Braille representations of text characters.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This project involves constructing a 1.75 billion parameter GPT-2 based model from scratch. Training was conducted using the NCSA’s HAL Cluster. Key features of the project include innovative data generation techniques and rlhf using ppo. A simple chatbot UI was built using Gradio, and a “phone-call mode” was implemented for a more personal experience, leveraging AssemblyAI and Google Cloud technologies.</p>
