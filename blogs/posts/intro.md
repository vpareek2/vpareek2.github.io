# Welcome

I am Veer. I like to predict things based on data. 

## Background
I recently graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a major in data-science and minors in computer science and french. I just moved to the bay area and I am now working at Striim, a real-time data streaming company as a machine learning engineer. I have always loved to use data to make predictions. From being a child predicting the whole nfl season based on the previous stats to running efficiency simulations for lineups on nba2k15, I have always enjoyed data science. In modern times, the world has become obsessed with predicting the next-token, as have I. I'm writing this blog/maintaining this website mostly to ensure I keep tinkering with projects and keep learning.

## Current projects
Currently I am in a bit of a lull space where I am not working on a major project. I am mostly refining my skills in core computer science topics so I can excel at my current role of a swe/mle. I am also getting my math skills better to gain a deeper intuition into machine learning topics. I may document some learnings here as well. But in my free time, I think about what "high-quality" data actually means in the current state of ML. Also, how core technologies will change as the world gets more accustomed to Natural Language Interfaces. 

While I have a lot of projects on my github, my most impactful work has come through my research at UIUC, post incoming. 

Feel free to reach out with any questions, advice, or anything else.
